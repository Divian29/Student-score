1)Given the following data definition, select all queries that return the second largest salary.
 Note that some employees may have the same salary.
 Please note that there may be more than one correct option.

 the correct queries for this : If we have employees A, B, and C whose salaries are $100, $80, and $100 respectively,
 note that the second highest salary is $80 although there are two employees with a higher salary.

 ANSWER:
   SELECT DISTINCT(salary) FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

   SELECT MAX(salary) FROM emp WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM emp);

   SELECT salary FROM (SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2) AS emp ORDER BY salary LIMIT 1;


2) SELECT g.year, c.country
   FROM games g
   JOIN city_country c
       ON g.city = c.city
   ORDER BY g.year;
| year | country |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1896 | Greece  |
| 1948 | UK      |
| 2004 | Greece  |
| 2008 | China   |
| 2012 | UK      |


3)
a)LEFT JOIN (left table keeps all its rows)
  Meaning:

  Returns all rows from the LEFT table (games)

  Returns matching rows from the RIGHT table (city_country)

  If no match exists, RIGHT side columns become NULL

  SQL example :SELECT g.year, g.city, c.country
               FROM games g
               LEFT JOIN city_country c
                   ON g.city = c.city;
| year | city    | country |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| 2004 | Athens  | Greece  |
| 2008 | Beijing | China   |
| 2012 | London  | UK      |
| 2032 | NULL    | NULL    |

 b)RIGHT JOIN (right table keeps all its rows)
 Meaning:

 Returns all rows from the RIGHT table (city_country)

 Returns matching rows from the LEFT table (games)

 If no match exists, LEFT side columns become NULL

 SELECT g.year, g.city, c.city, c.country
 FROM games g
 RIGHT JOIN city_country c
     ON g.city = c.city;

| year | city (games) | city (country) | country   |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------- | --------- |
| 2004 | Athens       | Athens         | Greece    |
| 2008 | Beijing      | Beijing        | China     |
| 2012 | London       | London         | UK        |
| NULL | NULL         | Sydney         | Australia |

4) correct SQL query to return each userId whose account has more than one session,
 along with their average session duration:
 SELECT
     userId,
     AVG(duration) AS AverageDuration
 FROM sessions
 GROUP BY userId
 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

explanation
GROUP BY

Groups all rows by userId.

AVG(duration)

Computes the average session duration per user.

HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

Filters groups to only include users with more than one session.
